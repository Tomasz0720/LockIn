# LOCKin Progress
## Mila's Log and Activity
### Adding Practice Questions
- Completed add Practice question, which will now add the practice question to each user's list, using the ```ChatServer``` and ```ClientApplication``` to send messages. 
- Also, every time another user does something (answer/add a question), it will automatically be displayed as a message on the chat
- **UI:** updated the UI when you insert a question, uses the dialog format
### Login System
- The login system looks way better now, you can add a new user or login. 
- The login will search your name in a json file called ```users.json``` 
- **NEED TO DO**: Make it so that when someone creates a new account, this user automatically gets updated to everyone's json file, so other users could access that name. (IDK is this mandatory??? LMk what you guys think)

### Possible Tasks
#### UI
- clean up the UI it lowk looks a little murked; add some personality 
- add the LOCKin Logo!! 

#### Features 
- add a pomodoro timer (maybe)
- maybe when pomodoro timer is started, informs other users
- lowk adding sound effects would be cool!!
- add a to-do list (where the whiteboard was supposed to go)

and that's I think it. Use this Read me to also try updating your progress
