# Documentation for LockIn
### Project Overview
LockIn is a student-focused desktop application designed to make studying more manageable and collaborative. Built with a clean, modern user interface, LockIn allows users to create an account, log in, and connect with others through a real-time chat system powered by a central chat server. Once inside, users can message one another, work through practice questions, and stay productive using an integrated Pomodoro timer. Whether studying solo or with peers, LockIn creates a supportive virtual environment to help students stay focused and engaged.
